## Problem description
The project is designed for solving the problem of unfair reviews on different kinds of products. Some distributors might be able to manipulate and influence on the reviews left on their websites. Our solution makes the process of reviewing absolutely transparent and clear for the customers. The widgets we provide connect to a smart contract in the Ethereum network. The source of the smart contract is published in the repository, so, you can verify the code of the smart contract in the actual network. The widgets we provide give a customer the ability to give feedback and to securely store the information on the blockchain. 

## Solution description
The solution we have now contains the source of the smart contract for storing reviews and the source of a sample page with our widget. In future a page with a generator of widgets and a description of our project for customers are planned.
The product will make the connections to the customers reliable and transparent without much effort.

## Team
The project was done by Paul Danilin and Anton Salagaev. We met at the Blockchainhack on 01.07.2017. 

## Tools
We have decided to use Ethereum to control of the logic of reviewing and storing the reviews. We also use Metamask for the inbrowser communication with the smart contract in the Ethereum network. We also use Ethereum for DAO of our project and Waves for monitoring and publication of the products manufacturers.
